      <h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>
Given the wrestling competitions held in New Zealand and the lack of a comprehensive online system for participants and organizers, this web-based platform has been developed. The purpose of this system is to provide real-time information to all wrestling stakeholders, including wrestlers, coaches, parents, clubs, and event organizers.</p>  

<p>Currently, the platform can display the list of competitions, match brackets, and results to visitors, while also enabling organizers to input related data. In future phases, many additional features will be added to further streamline wrestling-related activities.</p>
